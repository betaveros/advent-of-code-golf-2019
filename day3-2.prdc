  J  .. zip with one-indexed indices
  ›ø .. "organize" by the last element, i.e. the pair of coordinates: grouping like pairs
  ›m .. then just take the last element of each group
  .. so now we have a list of [steps, [x, y]]
}d
+   .. concatenate,
›ø  .. "organize" by the last element again
»f  .. filter for groups with nonempty tail, i.e. groups of size > 1,
‹šm .. for each such group map to its step-count and sum,
Œ   .. and take the min
